Rich Hickey, David Nolen, et al hit a homerun with Clojure/Clojurescript. But while cljs is a pleasure to work with, it can be hard to get started or find just the right documentation to answer your question. The community is putting a great deal of work into improving that; this site is part of my contribution to that effort.

cljs made me love front end development. No more [wtfjs][wtfjs], mutable state flying everywhere, hacking around the lack of namespaces, figuring out what `this` refers to, etc. Hopefully, cljs will do the same for you.

If there's any way at all that I can help you, please reach out via [email][email] or [twitter][twitter]. I also try to help out on reddit [clj][clj]/[cljs][cljs] and #clojurescript freenode. Lastly, the best way for you to get frequent tips and code examples is to sign up for my mailing list:
